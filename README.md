## CMSC828M Final Project (Spring 2020)
This repository contains the source code for the toy example used in [Security Games in Urban Neighborhoods: Urban Development Planning as Computing Optimal Resource Allocations](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hfzxfvvmvzms)

### Getting Started 
1. Create the `urban-security` conda environment to install dependencies: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
2. Activate the environment: `conda activate urban-security`

### Trying it Out
To try out the toy example, simply run `python example-problem.py`, and results will be printed in terminal.

##### Note: This example in the first iteration of the project contains many simplifying assumptions, and I hope to continue to refine it after the semester is over.
